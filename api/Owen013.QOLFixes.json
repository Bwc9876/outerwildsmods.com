{"readme":"# Quality of Life Changes\nAll of these features must be enabled in the config menu before you can use them.\n## Press 'Cancel' button to Exit Dialogue\nDo you want that character you're talking to to just *stop talking* so you can leave? Press the 'Cancel' button (usually Q on keyboard or B on gamepad) to exit a dialogue tree immediately!\n\n## Disable Time-Freezing during Dialogue at a Certain Location\nThere's an option in the vanilla game settings to freeze time while talking to characters. This can help make sure that you don't have to rush while talking to characters, but there's a certain location where that doesn't exactly matter. Enable this feature to disable time-freezing at that location!\n","externalImages":{}}
