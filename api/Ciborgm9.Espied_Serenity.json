{"readme":"# Espied Serenity\n\nThis addon for New Horizons adds a rogue planet similar to the one seen in the main menu of the game. It dosen't have much content or a story (at least for now) but I figured out that it is a cool place for hanging out, plus it does feature a little easter egg. However, don't expect frequent updates, I am a busy dude. I hope you like visiting it, any suggestion is welcomed!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571338136869928971/1020727591600128040/unknown.png)\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571338136869928971/1020728269986861147/unknown.png) \n\n![alt text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571338136869928971/1020728330238050405/unknown.png) \n","externalImages":{"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571338136869928971/1020727591600128040/unknown.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/221717566-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/221717566-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571338136869928971/1020728269986861147/unknown.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/2129385828-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/2129385828-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"},"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571338136869928971/1020728330238050405/unknown.png":{"url":"/images/optimized/-252958602-w800h1080finside.webp","openGraphUrl":"/images/optimized/-252958602-w800h1080finside.webp","width":800,"height":450,"format":"png"}}}
